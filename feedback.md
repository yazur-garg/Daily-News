# Task 3

### Use cases 
- **User edits their Category Preferences (done by Arryell Parris)** - There is an extra Main Flow that seems to be unrelated to this. One of the alternate flows seens to be out of place. 6/10
- **User search for News Data By using Keywords (done by Yazur Garg)** - Step two of the main flow should have been broken down 8/10
- **User search for Weather data (By Anshul Gandhi)** - The Actor field should only explain who the actor is. Main flow does not mention API. Steps 2 and 3 are out of synch. I belive that the idea was to let users either select a previously favorited location, or choose a new one. However, this is not clear from the flow. Multiple typos. 4/10
- **User creates an account ( By Divnoor Bhandohal)** - More alternate flows should have been considered. For example, if the user cancels the actions prior to the end. 8/10

### Milestones (3/5)
- Item 5 should be broken down into back end and hosting
- Item 6 should be removed (it is part of each step)
- Item 11 should porbably discuss the design of the "pushing the application to the host"

### Deliverables (5/5)
- Great!!! No changes requested
